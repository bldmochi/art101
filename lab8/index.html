			<h1>⋆⁺｡˚⋆˙‧₊☽  Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks ! ☾₊‧˙⋆˚｡⁺⋆ </h1>


			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>˚₊‧꒰ა challenge ! ໒꒱ ‧₊˚</h2>
					<p>  for this lab we experimented with anon functions and calling functions back! we had to make an array, and then use mapping to run that array through an anon function, and a normal function. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>˚₊‧꒰ა problems ! ໒꒱ ‧₊˚</h2>
					<p> this lab was a bit more difficult, trying to figure out the right syntax to use and how to use the mapping action. it took me a bit of trial and error to understand what i needed to do and what i was doing. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>˚₊‧꒰ა reflection ! ໒꒱ ‧₊˚</h2>
					<p> this was one of the more difficult labs, but i was able to do it with help from my partner and some friends. i feel like i know a bit more about how functions work, but i'm still a bit confused about the purpose of anon functions. </p>
			</div>
