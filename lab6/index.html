					<h2>˚₊‧꒰ა challenge ! ໒꒱ ‧₊˚</h2>
					<p>This lab was similar to our previous lab, just with a few more steps and specifications. For this lab we started working with arrays and objects in Javascript in order to talk about our transportation.</p>

					<h2>˚₊‧꒰ა problems ! ໒꒱ ‧₊˚</h2>
					<p>I had a few issues with my Javascript, as I kept getting errors and I didn't know why. I also kept getting "NaN" showing up on my browser, and also wasn't sure why. I messed around with the code and eventually fixed it, but I'm still not quite sure what happened. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>˚₊‧꒰ა reflection ! ໒꒱ ‧₊˚</h2>
					<p>Overall working with the Javascript was a bit difficult but eventually I got it working! It wasn't too bad, it is just a bit finnicky. </p>

					<h2>˚₊‧꒰ა results ! ໒꒱ ‧₊˚</h2>
