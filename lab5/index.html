					<p> Initially starting to understand how Javascript works was a little tricky. It really is like learning a new language. I still don't quite understand how it works but I knew enough to do this lab! </p>

					<h2>𑁍 reflection 𑁍</h2>
					<p>It's cool that I was able to start writing in Javascript! It seems like it has a lot of potential and can do a lot of cool things. I'm excited to see what else we can make with it. </p>
