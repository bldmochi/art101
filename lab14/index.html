			<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools and Strategies </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab we were tasked with going back to one of our old labs and debugging an issue we might've previously had.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Obviously since the task of the lab was to do some debugging there were some issues trying to figure out what the problem was. Luckily though with the help of Wesbot and the console I was able to solve my issues! </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I was able to successfully debug my code with the help of the solutions Wes provided to us! </p>

						<p> For this lab I decided to debug my work for lab 9. I had ran into the problem where my button only worked for one of the divs on the page, and didn't click for any of the others. In order to fix this I went into the console to see the issue, then went to Wesbot to ask how I can fix my problem. From there I took his advice, experimented, and saw what was happening in the console, to figure out the issue and make the buttons work individually for each div! </p>
