			<h1>Lab 9 - Libraries and jQuery </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>for this lab we were tasked with creating a button using jQuery that toggles the class and CSS of divs in our HTML. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> The tricky part about this lab is making sure everything is linked correctly, because that's where I got stuck. After going through and making sure all my files and links were in order my function started working </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I like everything that jQuery has to offer, and I like that we are making real interactive web pages now! </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					click the button to see my results! 
					<div id="output"></div>
