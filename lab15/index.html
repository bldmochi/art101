					<p>For this lab we were tasked with creating a button that utilized AJAX to produce something</p>

					<p> I had a few problems with this lab. At first I wanted to use the pokemon API for it, and had a bit of a struggle figuring out what constants I had to make to get the name and description to pop up. But once I got that working, the description was in German! And I couldn't figure out how to get the english version of the text. So I just decided to switch to an easier API, the dad joke API. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2> ᠃ ⚘᠂ ⚘  reflection  ⚘ ᠂ ⚘ ᠃ </h2>
					<p>API's are a bit confusing to be honest. It's hard to understand what information you need to use in order for it to print correctly. </p>
			</div>

					<h2> ᠃ ⚘᠂ ⚘ results ⚘ ᠂ ⚘ ᠃ </h2>
