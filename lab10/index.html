					<h2> ˚₊‧꒰ა  challenge !  ໒꒱ ‧₊˚</h2>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2> ˚₊‧꒰ა  problems ! ໒꒱ ‧₊˚</h2>
					<p> for this lab i struggled a bit creating the function that generates the text when it is pressed. just got confused with where to put what commands. i also struggled quite a bit on the task X, making the generated text appear like a text conversation. it took me a lot of experimenting and some research until i found out how to do it. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>˚₊‧꒰ა  reflection ! ໒꒱ ‧₊˚</h2>
					<p> This assignment was pretty simple on the face level but doing the extra work like task X was difficult. but it is cool to create buttons that do cool things! </p>
